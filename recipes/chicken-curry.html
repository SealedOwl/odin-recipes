    <h3>How to Make Chicken Curry Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li><br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil<br> in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken<br> breasts to a plate and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil<br> remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to<br> 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1<br> tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1<br> minute while stirring.</li><br>
        <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to<br> the mixture; stir to combine. </li><br>
        <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in<br> 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce.<br> Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the<br> center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer<br> inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle<br> with lemon juice to serve.</li>
